create a aethetic minimalist home page using react. use background color while and Cornsilk.

In the center of the page, add a chat window where user can chat with the AI assistant.

On the left hand side, add multiple components that should feel like floating. A component can be gmail, slack, teams, jira, github. use their icons as well. each component will represent a message for the user. for example, mail component will say " you have 10 new mails. 3 of them needs immediate action".

create seperate file for each components since we will add more actions for them later.

On the right hand side, show the calendar for the user with all the details and commitments for them on that day

Include thoughtful details like hover states, transitions, and micro-interactions. Apply design principles: hierarchy, contrast, balance, and movement. Include as many relevant features and interactions as possible. Create a fully-featured implementation beyond the basics.
